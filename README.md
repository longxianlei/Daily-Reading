### The power and responsibility in AI companies.

*Even as AI creates tremendous wealth, I worry about the growing concentrations of power and wealth, and those who will be left behind. Government will have to step up to address this situation, but significant responsibility also lies with the all of us who conceive, build, and manage this technology. I ask each of you to use your knowledge wisely, in ways that benefit society at large rather than a select few — even if that “select few” is yourself.*

### **2021-01-19.**

#### The U.S national election and its democracy. 

*Citizens have become polarized. Some politicians have become brazen in their disregard for facts. Voters have been suppressed. The press has been vilified and attacked. Similar things have happened in other countries, and formerly healthy democracies have fallen into populism, authoritarianism, or totalitarianism.*

*Organizations that are tested — and that survive the test — end up stronger.* 

*January 6, 2021, was a nadir for the U.S., and the path ahead will be long and hard. But I believe the country has reached a turning point. <u>I hope the dire events of the past week will renew our appreciation of just how precious sound government is.</u>* 

2021年1月6日是美国的最低点，前进的道路将是漫长而艰难的。 但是我相信这个国家已经到了一个转折点。 我希望过去一周的可怕事件将使我们重新认识到健全的政府是多么宝贵。

World models are young enough that something as simple as changing the components used can make a big difference. This suggests that plenty of opportunity remains to improve existing models.

### 2020-12-30.

#### Three wishes we have for AI in the upcoming year. 

1. **Narrow the gap between proofs-of-concept and production.**

2. **Strengthen the AI community with shared values.**

   It is more important than ever to establish a shared set of values, so we can support each other in doing good. Let’s make sure the AI community doesn’t splinter into different factions like the political sphere in some countries. We need to put more energy into understanding each other, have vigorous — yet civil — debates, and hopefully still come together as one community.

3. **Ensure that the outcomes of our work are fair and just.** 

#### The  Leaders of the AI community discuss their hopes in this special issue

1. **Training in Ethical AI.**

   **On going learning of ethical AI.** All it takes is for a few leaders to set a new direction, and the entire field will shift.

2. FeiFei_Li, **Invigorating the U.S. AI Ecosystem.**

   respects values fundamental to democratic societies. 民主社会的基本价值观。AI is a tool, and a profoundly powerful one. But every tool is a double-edged sword, and the ways it’s applied inevitably reflect the values of its designers, developers, and implementers. Many challenges remain to ensure that AI is safe and fair, respects values fundamental to democratic societies, protects individual privacy, and benefits a wide swath of humanity. Invigorating the healthy public ecosystem of AI research is a critical part of this effort.

3. **Life-Saving Models in Your Pocket** low cost DNN models.

   Deep neural networks in small, low-cost, battery-powered devices. Research has shown that, in many real-world cases, using low-precision numbers inside neural networks has little to no impact on accuracy.

   My hope for AI in 2021 is that sophisticated healthcare applications enabled by large neural networks running on small devices will usher in a new era of personalized healthcare that improves the lives of billions of people.

4. **Assisted Artistry**, AI help people in creativing art.

   there are some tasks at which humans continue to **reign supreme**. 至高无上。A human brain has a logical side, or left brain, which is complemented by the creative and imaginative right brain. 

   I look forward to seeing more AI creation tools in the coming year to help people express their artistic ideas and inspirations. AI has already shown that it can help humans to be more productive. Now let’s turn our attention to helping people to unlock their creativity.

#### The  phase of development a project: proof of concept or production.

1. *During the proof of concept (POC) phase, the primary goal is to determine if a system is worth building and deploying.* *When building a POC, my goal is to move fast. We’ve all been told we should build replicable, robust, and scalable systems — but when I haven’t even determined if a project is technically feasible, I often trade replicability for speed.* *If you already have a platform for experimentation, you may be able to build POCs in a systematic and robust way without sacrificing speed. But if you don’t, avoid over-investing in infrastructure at this stage. Instead, focus on getting the key information you need: whether this project is worth taking to production.*

2. *In contrast, during the production phase, the goal is to build and deploy a system that generates practical value. I might go back to the messy POC and make sure that every step is replicable and documented. I put a lot of thought into scalable data pipelines, monitoring systems, and reliability.*

#### Every Picture Tells a Story. 

​	Disabled web users in the U.S. file hundreds of [lawsuits](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/supreme-court-wont-hear-dominos-pizza-website-access-dispute) annually against Internet companies that don’t make their services accessible. Increasingly, online accessibility is recognized as a right, not a privilege.

#### Drones Unleashed

​	With drones now flying out of an operator’s line of sight, it’s more important than ever to subject their hardware and software to robust safety testing and verification.

### 2021-02-19

#### Annual Report, Robot Edition.

​	Companies have every incentive to tweak their reports to impress their audience, whether readers consist of wetware or software. But there’s a slippery slope between painting a rosy picture and exaggerating in ways that border on fraud.

#### The wild wind of stock trading.

​	Ultimately, trading creates little, if any, net wealth. When there are so many opportunities to grow the pie, why would we work so hard on activities that keep the pie the same size but squeeze out a bigger piece for ourselves at others’ expense?

### 2021-03-14

#### 	Five steps to help you scope projects effectively.

​	How to startup a new AI-involved business or project, here are some insights.

​	Step 1: **Identify a business problem (not an AI problem).** I like to find a domain expert and ask, “What are the top three things that you wish worked better? Why aren’t they working yet?”

​	Step 2: ***Brainstorm AI solutions.*** Find out some possible solutions to that problems.

​	Step 3: ***Assess the feasibility and value of potential solutions.*** You can justify whether an approach is feasible by looking at literatures or consulting domain experts.

​	Step 4:  ***Determine milestones.*** Step 5: ***Budget for resources.***

#### AR **Eyeglasses** 

​	A Facebook foray into mass-market face recognition could force U.S. lawmakers finally to issue rules on how the technology can and can’t be used.

#### AI in the Covid-19.

​	AI examines X-ray images to predict which Covid-19 patients are at greatest risk of decline.

​	The pandemic has been an [early test](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7797891/) of AI’s utility in medicine. The record so far has been [mixed](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1328), but we’re glad to see research that shows promising results for both fighting Covid and improving healthcare in general.

​	Pretraining followed by fine-tuning opens up important applications where data is too scarce for simpler learning approaches.

#### Ethical AI

​	Under Gebru and Mitchell, Google’s Ethical AI team developed [tools to improve model transparency](https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/29/google-releases-model-card-toolkit-to-promote-ai-model-transparency/), examined how [social constructs of race manifest in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03593), and released a [framework for identifying risks posed by models in development](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3351095.3372873). We hope the people who carry on this work will pursue similarly ambitious projects.

### A message from Andrew N.g. 2021-03-14. 

### Which talk about the communicate ability in a mordern team or company.

​	Engineers need strong technical skills to be successful. But many underestimate the importance of developing strong communication skills as well.

​	Many AI products are so complex that it’s hard for any single person — no matter how talented — to build the whole thing. As teamwork becomes more central to AI development, clear communication is becoming more important, too.

​	In large and small companies, I’ve seen senior engineers with no management responsibility (often called individual contributors) whose words carried more weight than those of VPs who managed large teams. They often had a massive positive impact on the projects they took part in. How did they accomplish this? These individuals are generally:

- *Technically sophisticated, with a deep understanding of the most promising technical approach to a problem.*
- *Cross-functional collaborators who can help match technology with business goals.*
- *Positive contributors to the company’s culture. For example, they foster a transparent and safe environment where ideas are evaluated based on merit and all voices can be heard.*
- *Clear communicators who help others understand their thinking through speaking or writing.*

​	What if you’re not yet a strong communicator? That’s okay! I used to struggle with my writing and speaking as well, and I still have ample room for improvement. Last week, while I was giving a practice talk on a new way to think about data (yes, I do practice talks), a friend told me that a section of my presentation was confusing. He was right! I try to embrace    critical feedback on my communications and hope you will, too.

​	There’s no need to set an impossible standard for yourself; just aim to improve a little every month. The only person you should compare yourself to is the person you used to be. Let us all keep trying to be better than our previous selves.

#### **Drones For Defense** (Another article about AI in developing weapons.)

​	Drone startups are taking aim at military customers.  

​	Until a ban is in place — one that has clear boundaries and mechanisms for enforcement — profit-seeking companies are sure to develop lethal AI. *The Batch,* along with more than 100 countries and thousands of AI scientists, opposes development of fully autonomous lethal weapons. 

#### An annual report about AI trends from Stanford University,

​	AI Index 2021 by analyzing academic research, investment reports, and other data sources. 

[	THE AI INDEX REPORT. Measuring trends in Artificial Intelligence](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/report/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_-bpm3lEK5y9FPV6o9CgFsFsZXGafSvQy0TAKpj6vZRS2gq8TGr5pNL-zwlKMsKuvTqdna5-usqBFG3rkdCTYeGGwLSQ)

#### ImageNet pretraining is not the only-one best choice in some domain. 

This just talk about the ImageNet and X-Ray image, they are not the same thing. It's obviously that the performance on ImageNet pretraining and fine-tune will have correlated efficient. Medical Image and daily image have structure and essential different. 

They found that accuracy on ImageNet did not correlate with performance on the fine-tuned tasks. 	

So knowledge gained from ImageNet may not transfer to medical images.	As researchers strive to improve performance on ImageNet, they may be overfitting to the dataset. Moreover, **state-of-the-art ImageNet models are not necessarily ideal for processing domain-specific data.** 

​	Language models have made huge advances through pretraining plus fine-tuning. It would be interesting to see the results of a similar analysis in that domain.

#### **Social Engagement vs. Social Good**(社交参与与社会公益). The balance of business and ethical for a social company.

A responsible AI and an ethical AI team is to achieving a balance between commercial profit and social impact. 

Facebook, like many AI companies, is struggling to balance business priorities with its social impact. Teams like Responsible AI are crucial to achieving that balance, and business leaders need to give them authority to set technical priorities and limits.

The powers of AI can put machine learning engineers **in the difficult position of mediating between business priorities and ethical imperatives.** We urge business leaders to empower employees who try to do the responsible thing rather than throttling their work, even if it negatively impacts the bottom line.

#### **Who Audits the Auditors?**

Auditing is a critical technique in the effort to build fair and equitable AI systems. There’s no consensus on how AI should be audited, whether audits should be mandatory, and what to do with their result.

A phenomena. How to audit the AI software or application's truly effectiveness.

- An audit of hiring software made by Pymetrics, which evaluates candidates through simple interactive games (illustrated above), did examine its code and found it largely free of social biases. But the audit didn’t address whether or not the software highlighted the best applicants for a given job.

As AI has many impacts on people's daily life, which influence their loans, travels, and so on. AI systems increasingly affect the lives of ordinary people, influencing whether they land a job, get a loan, or go to prison. These systems must be trustworthy — which means the audits that assess them must be trustworthy, too.

A good explain of the critical for audit AI.

> Makers of drugs and medical devices must prove their products are effective and safe. Why not makers of AI, when its output can dramatically impact people’s lives? The industry should agree on standards and consider making audits mandatory for systems that affect criminal justice, allocating health care resources, and offering loans. 

#### Your Words, Their Voices. A good way to transfer a impolite voice to a gentle voice.😄.

​		Have you ever been yelled at? We would love to build a system to transcribe the yeller’s words, and then re-synthesize their voice in a more polite tone.

#### Shift from model-centric to data-centric.

​		*When a system isn’t performing well, many teams instinctually(本能) try to improve the Code. But for many practical applications, it’s more effective instead to focus on improving the Data.*

Here are some tips.

> Different data labelers draw bounding boxes consistently? Do speech transcriptionists label ambiguous audio consistently, for instance, writing “um, yes please” rather than “um … yes please”? 
>
> Does the input distribution x sufficiently cover the important cases?
>
> Does the data incorporate timely feedback from the production system, so we can track concept and data drift?

#### Paper Without Code, the spotlight of unreproducible results/ paper.

While we applaud the spirit of this effort, without a transparent review process and a public list of reviewers, it could be used to demean researchers unfairly. We urge other research venues and institutions to take up the cause. 

#### Surveillance everywhere.

While AI can help police catch criminals, we do not condone a silent erosion of civil liberties and privacy. We support clear, consistent guidelines on appropriate uses of face recognition, license plate readers, and other tracking technologies. 

**we will move humanity forward** 推动人类进步.

#### Tesla Safety Under Investigation

A standard autonomous driving software is Autopilot, for all vehicles, it’s meant to be used on highways with a center divider. Only brakes, acceleration, steering wheel.

Upgrade to Full Self-Driving. A higher-version of self-driving software. But it's not a fully autonomous. 

Still, the company’s reputation could take a battering, and hype about self-driving technology makes it harder for the AI community as a whole to gain trust and make progress.

While it may be true that Tesla’s self-driving technology is safer on average than human drivers, it doesn’t fit the description “full self-driving.” While Tesla’s work to promote clean energy has had widespread positive impact, it’s time for the company to drop that branding and for car makers to provide clear, consistent information about their autonomous capabilities.

#### Self-Attention model.Vision model get some attention.

Self-attention and convolution have complementary strengths. Self-attention layers enable a model to find relationships between different areas of an image, while convolutional layers help the model to capture details. Self-attention layers work best when inputs are small, while convolutional layers can shrink input size. Combining the two offers the best of both worlds.

#### How to start a ML project fast.

​	*Machine learning development is highly iterative. Rather than designing a grand system, spending months to build it, and then launching it and hoping for the best, it’s usually better to build a quick-and-dirty system, get feedback, and use that feedback to improve the system.*

​	**Data labeling:** As it's hard to get a clean and consistent labels on our first attempt, just use an initial set of guidelines to label some data, see what problems arise, and then improve the guidelines.

​	**Model training:** Not to overthinking the whole parameters, it's better to train an initial model, then use error analysis to drive improvements.

​	**Deployment and monitoring:** When deploying a machine learning system, we want to track various metrics and try to spot concept drift or data drift. Rather than try to design the perfect set of dashboards before launch, I find it more fruitful to pick a very large set of metrics, evolve them, and prune the ones that prove less useful.

#### Labeling Errors Everywhere

**It’s time for our community to shift from model-centric to data-centric AI development**. Many state-of-the-art models work well enough that tinkering with their architecture yields little gain in many problems, and the most direct path to improved performance is to systematically improve the data your algorithm learns from. You can check out Andrew’s recent talk on the subject [here](https://youtu.be/06-AZXmwHjo?utm_source=thebatch&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mlops-talk). *#DataCentricAI*

Previous inquiries into the problem focused on training rather than test sets, and found that training on a small percentage of incorrect labels didn’t hurt deep learning performance. Accuracy on a test set that’s rife with errors is not a true measure of a model’s ability, and bad labels in the test set have a disproportionate impact on bigger models.

#### How technology regain public's trust.

1. Straight talk, 2. Take responsibility, 3. Engage and empathize.

#### Attention and transformer for image generation.

In transformer-style self-attention, which evaluates the importance of each part of an input with respect to other parts of the same input, memory and compute cost grows quadratically with input size. Transformers, which alternate attention and fully connected layers, perform better than other architectures in language processing. This work, which alternates attention and convolutional layers, may bring similar improvements to image processing.

#### Defacing ImageNet, blurred people's face in an image.

Any loss of accuracy is painful, but a small loss is worthwhile to protect privacy. There’s more to life than optimizing test-set accuracy! We expect that most ImageNet-trained applications won’t suffer from the change, as they don’t involve objects that typically appear near to faces. Fine-tuning on a dataset obtained with permission might help for the rest.

#### AI Startup companies in the world. Cream of the Startup Crop.

**In the midst of massive global economic turmoil**（在大规模全球经济动荡中）, the AI industry continues to prosper. But, while AI’s impacts are global, U.S. companies continue to scoop up most of the rewards.

**We’re thinking:** Building companies is hard. To quote Theodore Roosevelt, credit should be given to the person “**who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood.”** To everyone working on a startup, we wish you success!

#### How much data do we need to collect when we begin a new machine learning project.

​	We should set a time limited for data collecting. *Next time you face an unfamiliar machine learning problem, get into the model iteration loop as quickly as possible, and set a limited period of time for collecting data the first time around, at least. You’re likely to build a better model in less time.* This can avoid collecting useless data or unsuitable data which we spent 1 or 2 month to get.🌚. 

#### RoboCoders

​	No AI system should replace a sacred rite of passage for neophyte coders: print(“Hello World!”).

​	If banks can get regulators and consumers to accept AI-assisted surveillance in branch offices, it will add momentum to wider adoption of the technology. 

#### Banking on computer vision, many banks deployment surveillance cameras to monitor the people in the Banks and ATM.

​	Many of these use cases seems more like surveillance than security. Without sufficient sensitivity to public concerns, such efforts is likely to inspire backlash. Organizations that aim to take advantage of this technology: Tread cautiously. 

#### Greener Machine Learning, the training and deployment of ML models are energy-consuming, we need to cut the carbon emissions.

​	The training and inference of AI models have large energy consumption, we need cut the carbon emissions for a green world.

​	Transfer learning and shrinking the networks can increase  energy efficiency. Dedicated chip for machine learning are more fast and efficient than GPUs, such as TPUs.

​	Training and deploying a large model can emit five times more carbon dioxide than a single car over the course of its lifetime. As AI becomes more widespread, energy efficiency becomes ever more important.

​	**We’re thinking:** There are bigger levers for reducing carbon emissions, such as transitioning the world away from coal power. Still, as a leading-edge industry, AI has an important role in building a green future.

Building and deploying production systems requires a lot of manual work. Discovering and correcting data issues, spotting data drift and concept drift, managing training, carrying out error analysis, auditing performance, pushing models to production, and managing computation and scaling.

#### Super-Human quality control.

Shift some responsibility to a machine Learning system, especially one that performs better than humans, would enable manufacturers to reallocate human attention elsewhere. 

A human-in-the-lopp deployment that maintains a feedback loop between human experts and algorithms is a powerful way to learn, for both people and machines.

#### A Chat with Andrew on MLOps: From Model-centric to Data-centric AI

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo&t=1450s

Watching the Andrew Ng's recent talk on machine learning operations about model-centric and data-centric. He taught us the importance of a consistence collected data is how important for a machine leaning model. We need to improve the data quality.

The basic processes of an application of machine learning project. The life cycle of ML project.

**Scope project --> Collect data --> Train model --> Deploy in production.**

When we have 500 examples, some of the data are labeled unconsistent. We get a 70% accuracy. In a model-centric view, we may think how can we tune the model architecture, training the model more optimally, to improve the performance. If we need more data, we may need 1500 examples to get the same accuracy as we modify/review and check the data, to make it more consistence.

In a data-centric view, we may think how can we modify the data, labeling these data more consistently, get more data, augment the data to improve the performance.

**So, the important task is: Ensure consistently high-quality data in all phases of ML project lifecycle.**

Good data is:

> * Defined consistently
> * Cover of important cases.
> * Has timely feedback from production data.
> * Sized appropriately.

#### Automatic Machine Learning 

Nobody want to build, deploy, and maintain thousands of models by hand. Automatically choosing architectures, training them, turning servers on and off, monitoring performance and data, and retraining when needed makes highly customized, highly scalable machine learning more practical and affordable.

#### Issue 93 This topic also talk about data-centric AI model.

Andrew insist that: AI system = code(algorithm/model) + data. In the previously decade years, researchers innovate so many models, algorithm, and learning strategies to improve the performance of Deep Learning. So, in the new era of AI, beside continue study the model, we should find another way to substantially put forward the roof the of Ai system. So, it's time to focus on the data. It's a un-development field. Following the development of AI algorithms/models, we may also use the same diagrams to research in data area. 

As Ng said: *To spur innovation on data-centric AI approaches, perhaps it’s time to hold the Code fixed and invite researchers to improve the Data.* *A huge amount of innovation — in algorithms, ideas, principles, and tools — is needed to make data-centric AI development efficient and effective.* 

*When AI was shifting toward deep learning over a decade ago, I didn’t foresee how many thousands of innovations and research papers would be needed to flesh out core tenets of the field. But now I think an equally large amount of work lies ahead to support a data-centric approach.*



### 2021-06-29. Tuesday.

​	This is for graduates, we should keep curiosity, humility and clueless for new period. Keep humble.

​	But now, looking back, I reflect on how clueless I was and how little I knew about AI, business, people, and the world in general. To this day, I don’t feel particularly clued in. Every year or so, I look back and marvel at how clueless I was a year ago, and I’m pretty sure I’ll feel the same way a year from now. This helps me to act with humility and avoid expressing unwarranted certainty.

#### Irresponsible AI. 

​	This is an era of irresponsible AI, many companies do not care about ethics. In contrast, if a company make their product ethical and transparency, follow the guideline of responsible AI, they will be popularized by users.

​	Never mind technical issues — taking the survey’s results at face value, a substantial percentage of large companies aren’t ready for AI transformation on an ethical level. Businesses that pursue AI without paying attention to ethical pitfalls run the risk of alienating customers and violating laws. 

​	Companies that pay attention to ethics — in AI and elsewhere — will reap rewards in the form of better products, happier customers, and greater fairness and justice in the world.

#### Data-centric AI. Again, Andrew told the new term and diagram many times.

​	Would love your feedback on this idea: AI Systems = Code (model/algorithm) + Data. Most academic benchmarks/competitions hold the Data fixed, and let teams work on the Code. Thinking of organizing something where we hold the Code fixed, and ask teams to work on the Data.

​	Hoping this will more closely reflect ML application practice, and also spur innovative research on data-centric AI development. What do you think?

#### Issue 97. Challenges to building AI products and businesses.

​	Compare with the traditional software development, there are huge different among them.

​	***Unclear technical feasibility.*** *AI startups bring higher technical risk than traditional software startups because it’s harder to validate in advance if a given technology proposal is feasible.*

​	***Complex product specification.****It’s extremely complex to specify operating conditions and acceptable error rates under various conditions.*

​	***Need for data.*** *If you’re building an AI product, you need to write code, but you also need access to data to train and test the system.*  *Those activities are hard to scale, but they afford access to data that can shape a scalable product.*

​	***Additional maintenance cost.*** *For AI systems, the boundary conditions are less clear. If you have trained a system to process medical records, and the input distribution gradually changes (data drift/concept drift), how can you tell when it has shifted so much that the system requires maintenance?*

#### Automated scoring machines.

​	Automated systems that are carefully designed and sensibly deployed could help streamline processes, reduce costs, and increase access. The technology doesn’t yet offer a substitute for good human judgement when it comes to sensitive tasks like assessing performance, but if it can show consistently fair and accurate judgement, it could help reduce the [noise](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/15/opinion/noise-bias-kahneman.html) that currently afflicts human grading.

#### Sorting Shattered Traditions, 整理破碎的传统

​	Computer vision is probing the history of ancient pottery. CNN is helping archaeology（考古学） development, which makes it more accurate to identify the ancient period of properties and cultural relics.

​	Machine learning could sift through heaps of pottery shards far more quickly, allowing the humans to focus on interpreting the results. **We’re thinking:** Even when experts correctly identify a fragment, they can’t always explain what features led them to their conclusion. Heat maps from machine learning models could help teach the next generation of archaeologists how to read the past.

#### Commercial flight and space exploration

Private entities are at the center of this week’s space boom, but I would love to see public entities play a bigger role. Space exploration has been criticized as a waste of resources, given the problems we have here at home. Of course, we need to work on problems such as the still-rampaging Covid-19, climate change, poverty, and injustice. I believe society will be best off if we pursue multiple meaningful projects simultaneously.



#### Automated hiring system, automate job interviews.

Matching prospective employers and employees is a nuanced process, and any attempt to automate it requires the utmost rigor. Applicants subject to a flawed algorithm could be barred from jobs they're  eminently qualified for, while prospective employers who rely on it could miss ideal candidates. 

#### When Algorithms Manage Humans, Amazon's automate driver management system.

Some delivery drivers fired by Amazon contend that the retailer’s automated management system played an unfair role in terminating their employment. But it doesn't consider the real sense, such as unavoidable delays caused by obstacles like long lines at Amazon distribution centers, gated apartment complexes, or bad weather.

All algorithms are prone to some degree of error. At a company the size of Amazon, even a tiny error can have a large impact. Every effort should be made to audit such systems for fairness, make sure the **tradeoffs between flexibility and efficiency** are transparent, and treat  individuals with compassion and respect.

#### Robotics are lack of data.

When even a fleet of robots isn’t able to generate enough data, that’s a sign of how data-hungry our algorithms are. It’s also a reminder of how far the current state of the art is from human-level AI. After all, infants have only one body’s worth of data to learn from.
